Welcome yourself to our *World Happiness Day Hackathon project*, also know as **Happy Hacks** - a rejoiceful place, full of fun emojis and happy ideas for the world!

HAPPY HACKS is a place where users can receive inspirational '**Happy Hacks**', that they can use to motivate and guide themselves towards happiness, with advice from others. The home page invites users to click a button to receive a random 'hack', generated by other users. Users can create their own hacks by completing a form and attach an emoji to the post, sharing their own tips for the benefit of others. Users can 'love' hacks in order to interact with other users. The text and associated emojis assist users in being able to filter posts for themed suggestions that are relevant to them.
